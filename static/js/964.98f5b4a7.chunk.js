I worked a lot for the [robotics association](https://arem.pages.emse.fr/site-web/fr/a_propos/) of my school (mostly technical parts). Among other things, I am fascinated by what we can create threw a mere semi-conducers and the development of medical devices and prototyping process.\n\n# Currently\n\nStudying in the [Mines de Saint Etienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/) (one of the top French engineering school), I have developed skills in computer science, embedded system and Microelectronics (my love at first sight). And I learned how to create a project from scratch using VHDL/Routing softwares to create a board, using PlatformIO/CubeIDE to program it if programmable and creating the packaging using 3D printing. What I enjoy most in this workflow is the development of the digital electronics.\n\n# Some history\n\n- At 5, I discovered computers while playing Adibou, an educational game.\n\n- At 7, I had my first interaction with 'real' video games when my parents gave me a Nintendo DS.\n\n- At 11, I discovered computer video games and especially Minecraft. I played this game for 4 years and it is one of the main reasons that I'm interested in electronics. I was fascinated by redstone circuits.\n\n- At 18, I had to leave my parents' house to continue my education, but I still needed a computer so my parents told me : \"You want one? Work for it!\". I worked in a kinder garden for a month to have enough money to buy my first computer, a discounted ROG computer, it was pretty good and I still use it today.\n\n- At 20, I discovered 3D printing, CNC technologies. I then discovered a world that was extraordinary, in which I could design anything that I want and create it.\n\n# I like\n\n- Swimming\n- 3D Printing\n- Electronics\n- Winter\n- Creating a project from scratch\n- Cooking\n\n# I dream of\n\n- having a workshop and knowing how to operate every device perfectly.\n- finding a job at your company.\n- creating my own computer : Designing my own processors, routing the mother board and modeling the casing.",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,l=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,c.jsx)(i.rU,(0,o.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Rapha\xebl Comps",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(r(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:l},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
