# Intro

I am an student and engineer to be. I worked a lot for the [robotics association](https://arem.pages.emse.fr/site-web/fr/a_propos/) of my school (mostly technical parts). Among other things I am facinated by what we can create threw mere semi-conducers and the developement of medical devices and prototyping process.

# Currently

Studying in the [Mines de Saint Etienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/) (one of the top French engineering school), I have developed skills in computer science, embedded system and Microelectronics (my love at first sight). And I learned how to create a project from scratch to top using VHDL/Routing softwares to create a board, using PlatformIO/CubeIDE to program it if programable and creating the packaging using 3D printing. What I enjoy most in this workflow is the development of the digital electronics.

# Some history

- At 5, I discovered computers while playing Adibou, an educational game.

- At 7, I had my first interaction with 'real' video games when my parents gave me a Nintendo DS.

- At 11, I discovered computer video games and especially Minecraft. I played this game for 4 years and it is one of the main reason that I'm interested in electronics. I was facinated by redstone circuits.

- At 18, I had to leave my parents' house to continue my education but I still needed a computer so my parents told me : "You want one? Work for it!" And I worked in a kinder garden for a month to have enough money to buy my first computer, a discounted ROG computer, it was pretty good and I still use it today.

- At 20, I discovered 3D printing, CNC technologies and thus I discovered a world that was extraordinary, in wich I could design anything that I want and create it.
